# CSharp-QR-Code-Discord-Scam-Bot
This is a discord bot impersonating captcha bot, in order to trick user into scanning a QR code and taking over their accounts.

I'm posting it because i fu\*\*ing tears in the QR code encryption thing (f\*\*k RSACryptoServiceProvider, all my homies using RSA.Create).

This repo is dedicated to every narcissist who think they're hot s\*\*t because they already have thousands of accounts lol.

## Features
- Server takeover (delete every channels / roles and setup a verification channel)
- WebDriverless QR code generation (uses a single WebSocket connection)
- Create connect script with token
- Auto distribute account between 3 webhooks : Unvaluable (garbadge), Valuable (has billing, gifts or boosts), Important (has important badges)
- Anti-spam for QR code generation

## Half-finished feature
- MFA Remover (just ask the user for their code lmao (‚åê‚ñ†_‚ñ†))

## Data collected
- Profile data (token, username, bio, flags, ...)
- Personal data (email, phone, ...)
- Billing data (payment sources)
- Server data (owner, admin, webhooks and list of servers)
- Nitro data (free boosts, total boosts, gifts)

## Commands
**!msg**: Send welcome message in current channel.

**!retard**: Ban everyone with a username starting with "!" (to ban anti-scam bots).

**!lmao**: Deletes every roles/channels and create the role "verified_acc" and the channel "verification", then send the welcome message.

**!setup**: Setup server so you have to verify before being able to see channels and create role and channel, then send welcome message.
